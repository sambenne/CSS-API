This will parse the CSS and tell you what browsers support it.

#So Far

I have just done a quick getting of the CSS selectors. Having some issues with media queries but I assume all `@selectors`. I will then need to work out what type of selector is being used. So I will need to create a data store of the different CSS selector types that I can then check against.

When I have working that out I can then build the IE data store of what each version can do. After all that its just a simple comparason.
